## Description

### Write a function that sums squares of numbers in list that may contain more lists

Example:

```js
var l = [1,2,3]
SumSquares(l) == 14

var l = [[1,2],3]
SumSquares(l) == 14

var l = [[[[[[[[[1]]]]]]]]]
SumSquares(l) == 1

var l = [10,[[10],10],[10]]
SumSquares(l) == 400
```

Note: your solution must NOT modify the original list

Another Kata involving nested lists here (it's still in beta - more honor points for completing :D): https://www.codewars.com/kata/5786f020e55533ebb7000153
