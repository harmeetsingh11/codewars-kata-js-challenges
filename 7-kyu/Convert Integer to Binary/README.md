# [Convert Integer to Binary](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55606aeebf1f0305f900006f)

### Difficulty: `7 kyu`

### Tags: `Fundamentals` `Binary`

## Description

Convert integers to binary as simple as that. You would be given an integer as a argument and you have to return its binary form. To get an idea about how to convert a decimal number into a binary number, visit [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary).

Notes: negative numbers should be handled as [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement); assume all numbers are integers stored using 4 bytes (or 32 bits) in any language.

Your output should ignore leading 0s.

### Examples (input --> output):

```
3  --> "11"
-3 -->"11111111111111111111111111111101"
```
