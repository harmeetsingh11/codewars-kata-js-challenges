To celebrate today's launch of my Hero's new book: `Alan Partridge: Nomad`, We have a new series of kata arranged around the great man himself.

### Task
Given an array of terms, if any of those terms relate to Alan Partridge, return `Mine's a Pint!`

The number of exclamation mark (`!`) after the `t` should be determined by the number of Alan related terms you find in the given array (`x`). The related terms are as follows:

```
Partridge
PearTree
Chat
Dan
Toblerone
Lynn
AlphaPapa
Nomad
```

If you don't find any related terms, return `Lynn, I've pierced my foot on a spike!!`
