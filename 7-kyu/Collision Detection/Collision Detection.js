/*
### Explanation
- Instead of using `Math.sqrt`, we compare **squared distances** to avoid the extra cost of computing a square root â€” this is both **faster** and **numerically more stable**.
- Two circles **collide** if the **distance between their centers** is **less than or equal** to the **sum of their radii**.
