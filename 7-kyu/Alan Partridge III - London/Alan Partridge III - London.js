function alan(stations) {
  // List of required stops
  const requiredStops = [
    'Rejection',
    'Disappointment',
    'Backstabbing Central',
    'Shattered Dreams Parkway',
  ];

  // Check if every required stop is present in the given stations list
  return requiredStops.every((stop) => stations.includes(stop))
    ? 'Smell my cheese you mother!'
    : 'No, seriously, run. You will miss it.';
}

/* 
### Explanation:
1. **Define Required Stops**: Create an array containing all the required stops.
2. **Check Presence**: Use `.every()` to check if all required stops exist in the given `stations` array.
3. **Return Appropriate Message**: If all stops are found, return `"Smell my cheese you mother!"`, otherwise return `"No, seriously, run. You will miss it.."`. 

This solution is efficient (O(n) complexity) and concise.
