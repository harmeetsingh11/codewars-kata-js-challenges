# [Pairs of integers from m to n](https://www.codewars.com/kata/588e2a1ad1140d31cb00008c)

### Difficulty: `7 kyu`

### Tags: `Fundamentals`

## Description

Implement a function that receives two integers `m` and `n` and generates a sorted list of pairs `(a, b)` such that `m <= a <= b <= n`.

The input `m` will always be smaller than or equal to `n` (e.g., `m <= n`)

### Example

```
m = 2
n = 4

result = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
```
