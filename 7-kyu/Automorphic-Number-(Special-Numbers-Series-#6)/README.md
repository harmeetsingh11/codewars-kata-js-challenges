## Description

A number is called **Automorphic number** if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself. For example, `25` is an automorphic number because its square (`625`) ends with `25`.

### Task

Given a positive number, determine if it is Automorphic or not. If it is, return `"Automorphic"`, otherwise return `"Not!!"`

### Examples

- 25 is an automorphic number, because $25^2=625$ ends with `25`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- 13 is not an automorphic number, because $13^2=169$ does not end with `13`, so return `"Not!!"`.
- 76 is an automorphic number, because $76^2=5776$ ends with `76`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- 225 is not an automorphic number, because $225^2=50625$ does not end with `225`, so return `"Not!!"`.
- 625 is an automorphic number, because $625^2=390625$ ends with `625`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- 1 is an automorphic number, because $1^2=1$ ends with `1`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- 6 is an automorphic number, because $6^2=36$ ends with `6`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
