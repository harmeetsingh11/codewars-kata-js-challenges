### ðŸ”Ž Explanation

1. **Convert visited list to a Set**

   * Lookup in an array (`.includes`) is `O(n)` â†’ costly if list is long.
   * A `Set` allows `O(1)` average lookup, making the solution efficient.

2. **Iterate over offered cities in order**

   * Since `citiesOffered` is already ranked by relevance, the first unvisited city is the best choice.

3. **Return fallback if none available**

   * If all offered cities are already visited, return `"No worthwhile conferences this year!"`.

---

### âœ… Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`
  where `m = number of visited cities`, `n = number of offered cities`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` for the `Set`.
