}

// Examples
console.log(findMissingElement([0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4])); // Output: 8
console.log(findMissingElement([9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1])); // Output: 3

/* 
Explanation:

Calculate the Total Sum:
The sum of integers from 0 to 9 can be derived using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers:
Sum= n*(n+1)/2
â€‹For n=9, the sum is 45.

Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:
Use the reduce function to sum up all the integers in the given sequence.

Find the Missing Element:
Subtract the sum of the sequence from the total sum to determine the missing number.

Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence (9 in this case).

Space Complexity: 
O(1), as it uses only a few variables without additional data structures.
