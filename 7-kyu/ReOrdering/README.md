## Description

There is a sentence that has a mistake in its ordering.

The part with a capital letter should be the first word.

Please write a function to re-order the words, so that the word starting with a capital letter is moved to the front.

Each word in the string is separated by a single space.

In the string, there will always be exactly one word with a capital letter in it.

### Examples

```js
"ming Yao" --> "Yao ming"
"Mano donowana" --> "Mano donowana"
"wario LoBan hello" --> "LoBan wario hello"
"bull color pig Patrick" --> "Patrick bull color pig"
```
