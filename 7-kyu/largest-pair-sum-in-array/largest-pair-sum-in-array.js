function largestPairSum(numbers) {
  // Sort the array in descending order (from largest to smallest)
  numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);

  // Return the sum of the first two largest numbers in the sorted array
  return numbers[0] + numbers[1];
}

/* 
Explanation:

Sorting in Descending Order:
The array is sorted using the sort function with a custom comparator (a, b) => b - a to ensure the numbers are sorted from the largest to the smallest.

Summing the Two Largest Numbers:
After sorting, the two largest numbers are the first two elements in the array, i.e., numbers[0] and numbers[1]. We return their sum.

Efficiency:
Time complexity: The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1) additional space (ignoring the input storage).
