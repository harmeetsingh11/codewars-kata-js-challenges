## Description

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

`Point` objects have `x`, `y` attributes. `Triangle` objects have attributes `a`, `b`, `c` describing their corners, each of them is a `Point`.

Write a function calculating perimeter of a `Triangle` defined this way.
