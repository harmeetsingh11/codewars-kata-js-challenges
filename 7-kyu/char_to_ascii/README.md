## Description

Take a string and return a hash with all the ascii values of the characters in the string. Returns `nil` (Ruby), `None` (Python) or `null` (JavaScript) if the string is empty. The key is the character, and the value is the ascii value of the character. Repeated characters are to be ignored and non-alphebetic characters as well.
