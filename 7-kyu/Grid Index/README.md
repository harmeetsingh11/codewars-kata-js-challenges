## Description

You are given an n by n ( square ) grid of characters, for example:

```js
[['m', 'y', 'e'], 
 ['x', 'a', 'm'], 
 ['p', 'l', 'e']]
```

You are also given a list of integers as input, for example:

```js
[1, 3, 5, 8]
```

You have to find the characters in these indexes of the grid if you think of the indexes as:

```js
[[1, 2, 3], 
 [4, 5, 6], 
 [7, 8, 9]]
```

Remember that the indexes start from one and not zero.

Then you output a string like this:

```js
"meal"
```

All inputs will be valid.
