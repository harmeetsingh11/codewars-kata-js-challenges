## Description

### Task

Implement a function which finds the numbers less than `2`, and the indices of numbers greater than `1` in the given sequence, and returns them as a pair of sequences.

Return a nested array or a tuple depending on the language:

- The first sequence being only the `1`s and `0`s from the original sequence.
- The second sequence being the indexes of the elements greater than `1` in the original sequence.

### Examples

```js
[ 0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 1, 0 ] => [ [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 6 ] ]
```
