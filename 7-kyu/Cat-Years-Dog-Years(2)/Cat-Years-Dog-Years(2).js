/* 
Explanation:

calculateHumanYears function:
This function calculates the equivalent "human" years for a given pet based on their age in "pet years."
It uses constants for the first year's value, the second year's value, and the subsequent year's value.
The logic ensures that the calculation correctly handles edge cases (e.g., years below the first or second year's thresholds).

Logic for catYears and dogYears:
Both catYears and dogYears are processed using the helper function to compute how long you've owned the cat and dog in "human years."

Efficiency:
The calculation uses simple arithmetic and is done in constant time, making it highly efficient.

Example Calculation:
For a cat aged 24 cat years:
First year: 15
Second year: 15 + 9 = 24 (matches catYears)
Youâ€™ve owned the cat for 2 years.
For a dog aged 39 dog years:
First year: 15
Second year: 15 + 9 = 24
Remaining years: 39 - 24 = 15
Additional human years: Math.floor(15 / 5) = 3
Total: 2 + 3 = 5 years owned.
