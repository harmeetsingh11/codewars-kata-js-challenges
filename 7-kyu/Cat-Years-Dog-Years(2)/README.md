### Difficulty: `7 kyu`

### Tags: `Fundamentals`

## Description

This is related to [my other Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/cat-years-dog-years) about cats and dogs.

### Kata Task
I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.

I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as `catYears` and `dogYears`.

Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [`ownedCat`, `ownedDog`]

### NOTES:

- Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years

### Cat Years
- `15` cat years for first year
- `+9` cat years for second year
- `+4` cat years for each year after that

### Dog Years
- `15` dog years for first year
- `+9` dog years for second year
- `+5` dog years for each year after that
