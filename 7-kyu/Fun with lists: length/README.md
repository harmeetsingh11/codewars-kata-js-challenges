## Description

Implement the method **length**, which accepts a linked list (head), and returns the length of the list.

For example: Given the list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, length should return 4.

The linked list is defined as follows:

```js
function Node(data, next = null) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = next;
}
```

Note: the list may be null and can hold any type of value.

Good luck!
