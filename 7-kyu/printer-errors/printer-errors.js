function printerError(s) {
  // The function calculates the error rate of a printer based on a given string `s`.
  // It assumes that the printer is supposed to print letters from 'a' to 'm' only.
  // Any letter outside of this range is considered an error.

  // `s.match(/[^a-m]/g)`:
  // This line uses a regular expression to find all characters in the string `s` that are not in the range 'a' to 'm'.
  // `[^a-m]` matches any character that is NOT between 'a' and 'm'.
  // The `g` flag means "global," so it searches the entire string for these characters.
  // If there are no matches, `s.match()` returns `null`, so the `|| []` ensures that it returns an empty array instead.

  // `.length`:
  // The length property counts the number of elements in the array returned by `s.match()`, which represents the number of errors.

  // `${...}/${s.length}`:
  // This uses template literals to create a string that shows the error rate as a fraction.
  // The numerator is the number of errors, and the denominator is the total length of the string `s`.
  // The final result is a string like "3/56", meaning 3 errors out of 56 characters.

  return `${(s.match(/[^a-m]/g) || []).length}/${s.length}`;
