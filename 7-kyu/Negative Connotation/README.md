## Description

You will be given a string with sets of characters, (i.e. words), seperated by between one and four spaces (inclusive).

Looking at the first letter of each word (case insensitive-`"A"` and `"a"` should be treated the same), you need to determine whether it falls into the positive/first half of the alphabet (`"a"`-`"m"`) or the negative/second half (`"n"`-`"z"`).

Return `True/true` if there are more (or equal) positive words than negative words, `False/false` otherwise.

```
"A big brown fox caught a bad rabbit" => True/true
"Xylophones can obtain Xenon." => False/false
```
