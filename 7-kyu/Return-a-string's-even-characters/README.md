## Description

Write a function that returns a sequence (index begins with 1) of all the even characters from a string. If the string is smaller than two characters or longer than 100 characters, the function should return "invalid string".

For example:

```
"abcdefghijklm" --> ["b", "d", "f", "h", "j", "l"]
"a"             --> "invalid string"
```
