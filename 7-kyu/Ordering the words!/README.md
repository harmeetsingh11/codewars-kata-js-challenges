## Description

Given a string, you need to write a method that order every letter in this string in ascending order.

Also, you should validate that the given string is not empty or null. If so, the method should return:

```
"Invalid String!"
```

### Notes
• the given string can be lowercase and uppercase.
• the string could include spaces or other special characters like '# ! or ,'. Sort them based on their ASCII codes

### Examples

```
"hello world" => " dehllloorw"
"bobby"       => "bbboy"
""            => "Invalid String!"
"!Hi You!"    => " !!HYiou"
```
