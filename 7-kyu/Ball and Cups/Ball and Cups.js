### üîé Problem Understanding

We have:

* **3 cups** labeled `1, 2, 3`.
* A ball initially placed under cup `b`.
* An array of swaps `arr`, where each swap is a pair `[x, y]` meaning cups at positions `x` and `y` are swapped.

We need to track where the ball ends up after all swaps.

---

### ‚ö° Efficient Approach

* Start with ball under `b`.
* Loop through each swap `[x, y]`.
* If the ball is under `x`, move it to `y`.
* If the ball is under `y`, move it to `x`.
* If the ball is under neither, do nothing.
* Return final position.

This approach runs in **O(n)** time (where `n` is number of swaps) and **O(1)** space.
---

### üìù Explanation

1. Start with ball at initial position `b`.
2. For each swap:

   * If ball is involved in the swap, update its position accordingly.
   * If not, ignore.
3. After all swaps, return the final position.
