## Description

Given 2 string parameters, show a concatenation of:

- the reverse of the 2nd string with inverted case; e.g `Fish` -> `HSIf`
- a separator in between both strings: `@@@`
- the 1st string reversed with inverted case and then mirrored; e.g `Water` -> `RETAwwATER` 

**Keep in mind that this kata was initially designed for Shell, I'm aware it may be easier in other languages.**
