/*
## ðŸ”Ž Explanation

We need to represent `n` consecutive **1s** moving from **right (LSB side)** to **left (MSB side)** in an **8-bit path**.

* Example: `n = 3`
  Start with `00000111` â†’ shift left each step until the leftmost side.
* Example: `n = 7`
  Start with `01111111` â†’ only 2 steps possible (`8 - n + 1` total steps).

ðŸ“Œ Formula:

* Number of steps = `8 - n + 1`
* At each step `i` (from `0` to `8 - n`), the bits pattern = `(1 << n) - 1` shifted left by `i`.

  * `(1 << n) - 1` â†’ creates `n` consecutive 1s.
  * `<< i` â†’ moves them left step by step.
---

## âš¡ Why this is Optimal?

* Uses **bit operations** (fastest possible for such problems).
* Runs in **O(8)** â†’ constant time, since path length is fixed (8 bits).
* Clean and minimal memory usage.
