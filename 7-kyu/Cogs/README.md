### Kata Task
You are given a list of cogs in a [gear train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train)

Each element represents the number of teeth of that cog

e.g. `[100, 75]` means

- 1st cog has 100 teeth
- 2nd cog has 75 teeth

If the first cog rotates clockwise at 1 RPM what is the RPM of the final cog?

(use negative numbers for anti-clockwise rotation)

### Notes
- no two cogs share the same shaft
