/*
This problem is about simulating umbrella movement between **home** and **work**, and tracking the **minimum number of umbrellas required initially** so that he never gets wet.

---

## âœ… Key Idea:

* Track how many umbrellas are at **home** and at **work**.
* If itâ€™s **raining**, he needs one umbrella at his current location:

  * If available â†’ use it, move it to the other place.
  * If not available â†’ he needs a **new umbrella**, so increase `needed`.
* If itâ€™s **not raining**, nothing happens.

This guarantees the minimal number of umbrellas since we only add a new one when strictly necessary.

---

## âœ¨ Explanation with Example:

### Input:

```js
["rainy", "clear", "rainy", "cloudy"]
```

* **Day 1 Morning (rainy):**
  No umbrella at home â†’ buy one â†’ `needed=1` â†’ move to work.
  (home=0, work=1)

* **Day 1 Afternoon (clear):**
  No rain â†’ do nothing.
  (home=0, work=1)

* **Day 2 Morning (rainy):**
  No umbrella at home â†’ buy one â†’ `needed=2` â†’ move to work.
  (home=0, work=2)

* **Day 2 Afternoon (cloudy):**
  No rain â†’ do nothing.

âœ… Final Answer = `2`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Complexity:

* **Time:** O(n) â†’ single pass through weather array.
* **Space:** O(1) â†’ only counters used.
