## Description

A natural number is called **k-prime** if it has exactly `k` prime factors, counted with multiplicity. For example:

```
k = 2  -->  4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ...
k = 3  -->  8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, ...
k = 5  -->  32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, ...
```

A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.

### Task:
Complete the function `count_Kprimes` (or `countKprimes`, `count-K-primes`, `kPrimes`) which is given parameters `k, start, end (or nd)` and returns an **array** (or a list or a string depending on the language - see "Solution" and "Sample Tests") of the `k-primes` between `start (inclusive)` and `end (inclusive)`.

### Example:

```
countKprimes(5, 500, 600) --> [500, 520, 552, 567, 588, 592, 594]
```

Notes:

- The first function would have been better named: `findKprimes` or `kPrimes` :-)
- In C some helper functions are given (see declarations in 'Solution').
- For Go: nil slice is expected when there are no k-primes between `start` and `end`.

### Second Task: puzzle (not for Shell)
Given a positive integer s, find the total number of solutions of the equation `a + b + c = s`, where a is 1-prime, b is 3-prime, and c is 7-prime.

Call this function `puzzle(s)`.

### Examples:
```
puzzle(138)  -->  1  because [2 + 8 + 128] is the only solution
puzzle(143)  -->  2  because [3 + 12 + 128] and [7 + 8 + 128] are the solutions
```
