/* 
Explanation:

GCD Function:
Computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is used to simplify calculations for the LCM.

LCM Function:
Computes the least common multiple of two numbers using the relationship:
LCM(a,b)=(axb)/GCD(a,b)
â€‹
Calculate Common Denominator:
Iteratively calculate the least common multiple of all denominators in the input list using Array.reduce().

Normalize Fractions:
For each fraction, scale the numerator to match the new common denominator by multiplying it by the appropriate factor (commonDenom/denom).

Return Result:
The result is a list of fractions with the same denominator and adjusted numerators.
we format each fraction as a string in the required form (N, D) and join these strings together.
The .join('') method combines all formatted strings into one continuous string without separators, matching the desired output.
