/*
- `matchAll(/\[([a-z]*)\]/g)` finds all shelters and their contents.
- For each shelter, we:
  - Determine its bounds.
  - Find how many `#` occur between this shelter and the next/previous one.
- If **2 or more `#` are close**, the shelter is **destroyed**.
- If **0 or 1 `#` is close**, the shelter **survives** and its letters are added to the result.
- Letters outside shelters are ignored if thereâ€™s any `#` on the battlefield.
