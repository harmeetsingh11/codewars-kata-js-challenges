/* 
Explanation:
1. Initialize:
    - `bestIndex`: To store the index of the best match.
    - `minDifference`: To track the smallest goal difference (initialized to Infinity).
    - `maxZamalekGoals`: To track the highest Zamalek goals for tie-breaking.
    
2. Loop through each match:
    - Calculate the goal difference: `ALAHLYGoals[i] - zamalekGoals[i]`
    - Check:
        - If the difference is smaller than `minDifference`, update `bestIndex`.
        - If the difference is the same but Zamalek scored more, update `bestIndex`.
        
3. Return the index of the best match.

This solution is efficient (O(n) time complexity) and concise, iterating through the matches only once.

This solution handles all edge cases, including:
1. Multiple matches with the same goal difference.
2. Selecting the match where Zamalek scored more goals.
3. Returning the smallest index in case of ties.
