### ðŸ”‘ Key Idea

* Use a **map (dictionary)** to track each playerâ€™s **current index** in the leaderboard.
* For each operation:

  * Parse the playerâ€™s name and movement (`+n` or `-n`).
  * Compute the new index.
  * Remove the player from their old index and insert at the new one.
  * Update the map for all affected players (because their positions shift).

This avoids repeatedly searching for players with `indexOf`, making it **faster and cleaner**.
---

### ðŸ“– Explanation

1. Loop through each movement like `"Fred +4"`.
2. Split into:

   * `name` â†’ `"Fred"`
   * `offset` â†’ `+4` (parsed to number `4`)
3. Since "up" means moving **toward the front** (lower index),
   we compute `newIndex = currentIndex - offset`.
4. Use `splice`:

   * Remove the player at their current position.
   * Insert them at the new position.
5. After all moves, return the updated leaderboard.

---

### âœ… Example Run

```js
let leaderboard = ['John','Brian','Jim','Dave','Fred'];
let changes = ['Dave +1','Fred +4','Brian -1'];

console.log(leaderboardUpdate(leaderboard, changes));
```

**Output:**

```
['Fred', 'John', 'Dave', 'Brian', 'Jim']
```

---
This solution is **concise, optimized (O(n\*m) worst case where n = players, m = moves), and easy to follow**.
