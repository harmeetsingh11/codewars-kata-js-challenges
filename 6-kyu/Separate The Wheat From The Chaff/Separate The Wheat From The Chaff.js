/*
We need to solve **wheatFromChaff** in **O(N)** time and **O(1)** extra space (apart from the result array, since input shouldn't be modified in Javaâ€”but in JS we can copy once and work in place).

The **best approach** is **two pointers**:

* One pointer `i` moves from the left.
* One pointer `j` moves from the right.
* If a positive number is found at the front (`i`), and a negative at the end (`j`), swap them.
* Keep negatives at the beginning as they are.
* Stop when `i >= j`.

This ensures **linear time, in-place separation**.

## ðŸ“œ Explanation

1. Start with two pointers:

   * `i` = 0 (beginning).
   * `j` = last index.

2. Traverse:

   * If `arr[i]` is negative â†’ keep it, move `i++`.
   * If `arr[i]` is positive and `arr[j]` is negative â†’ swap them, move both pointers.
   * If `arr[j]` is positive â†’ move `j--` until a negative is found.

3. Continue until `i >= j`.

This ensures negatives come first, positives last, preserving the rule that negatives at the start stay untouched.


## ðŸ”Ž Example Dry Runs

### Example 1

Input: `[7, -8, 1, -2]`

* i=0 â†’ 7 (positive), j=3 â†’ -2 (negative) â†’ swap â†’ `[-2, -8, 1, 7]`
  âœ… Done.

### Example 2

Input: `[-31, -5, 11, -42, -22, -46, -4, -28]`

* i=0,-31 (keep), i=1,-5 (keep),
* i=2,11 (positive), j=7,-28 (negative) â†’ swap â†’ `[-31,-5,-28,-42,-22,-46,-4,11]`
  âœ… Done.

âš¡ This runs in **O(N)** with **no extra memory** (just one copy), perfect for 100k+ elements.
