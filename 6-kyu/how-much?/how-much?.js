/* 
Explanation

Input Validation:
The range is normalized using Math.min and Math.max to handle both increasing and decreasing input ranges.

Iterate Through Possible Values:
Loop from the lower bound (start) to the upper bound (end) inclusive.

Check Conditions:
(f - 1) % 9 === 0: Ensures that after buying 9 cars, exactly 1 unit is left.
(f - 2) % 7 === 0: Ensures that after buying 7 boats, exactly 2 units are left.

Calculate Costs:
If both conditions are satisfied, compute the cost of a car (c) and a boat (b).

Store Results:
Add the formatted result to the results array in the specified format.

Return Results:
Return the array of possible solutions.

Efficiency
Time Complexity: 
O(nâˆ’m), where n and m are the range bounds. The modulo operations and arithmetic are O(1) for each f.
Space Complexity: 
O(k), where k is the number of valid solutions found.
