# [Reverse Vowels In A String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585db3e8eec141ce9a00008f)

### Difficulty: `6 kyu`

### Tags: `Fundamentals` `Strings`

## Description

In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

```
"Hello!" => "Holle!"
"Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
"Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
```

For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.

Good luck!
