/*
Explanation:

Splitting with Regular Expression:
We use .split(/(\s+)/) to split the string while keeping the spaces. The regular expression \s+ matches one or more spaces, and the parentheses () ensure that the spaces are included in the result.

Reversing the Array:
.reverse() reverses the order of words and spaces in the array.

Changing Case:
For each segment (either a word or a space), we check if it's a letter (uppercase or lowercase) and flip the case using .map(). Spaces are unchanged.

Rejoining the Segments:
Finally, .join('') is used to reassemble the string while preserving the spaces and word order.

/* 
Test Cases:
"Example Input" → "iNPUT eXAMPLE"
"bLING hOTLINE that wHEN kNOW yOU" → "bLING hOTLINE that wHEN kNOW yOU" (multiple spaces between words are preserved)
'tAXO xKUR cJPGF tQU' → 'tAXO xKUR cJPGF tQU' (multiple spaces are maintained)
