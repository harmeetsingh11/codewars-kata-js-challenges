This is a **number partitioning problem** with a constraint:

* We need to split `n` students into groups of **consecutive integers** (e.g., `5,4,3,2`).
* Groups must be in **decreasing order**.
* We want the **minimum number of groups**.
* If no such arrangement exists ‚Üí return `[-1]`.

### üîë Key Insight

The sum of `k` consecutive integers from `x-k+1` to `x` is:

$$
S = \frac{k(2x - k + 1)}{2}
$$

We need `S = n`.

* Rearranging gives us a quadratic in terms of `x`.
* If we can find integer `x` for some `k`, then groups exist.

We want the **smallest possible `k`** (minimum groups).

---

### ‚ö° Optimized Approach

1. Iterate `k` (number of groups) from **2** upwards.
   (since 1 group = whole class = trivial but not valid consecutive sequence)
2. Check if there exists an integer `x` (largest group size) such that the sum of `k` consecutive numbers = `n`.
3. If valid, build the sequence `[x, x-1, ..., x-k+1]` and return it.
4. If no `k` works, return `[-1]`.

This works efficiently because the sum grows quickly, so we don‚Äôt need to check large `k`.

### üìù Explanation with Example

For `n = 14`:

* Try `k=2`: not possible.
* Try `k=3`: not possible.
* Try `k=4`:

  $$
  2n/k = 28/4 = 7,\ \ 7 + (4-1) = 10 \implies 2x = 10 \implies x=5
  $$

  Sequence = `[5,4,3,2]`. ‚úÖ

For `n=2`:

* No `k` works ‚Üí return `[-1]`.
