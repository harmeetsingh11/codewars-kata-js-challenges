### Difficulty: `6 kyu`

### Tags: `Fundamentals`

## Description

In this Kata, you will be given two numbers, `a` and `b`, and your task is to determine if the first number `a` is divisible by `all` the prime factors of the second number `b`. For example: `solve(15,12) = False` because `15` is not divisible by all the prime factors of `12` (which include `2`).

See test cases for more examples.

Good luck!
