/*
### Explanation:

* Instead of generating all substrings (which would be O(nÂ²)), this method exploits the fact that a substring is odd if and only if its last digit is odd.
* For each odd digit at position `i`, there are `(i + 1)` substrings ending there (from index 0 to i, 1 to i, ..., i to i).
* Summing these counts for all odd digits gives the total number of odd substrings.

This solution runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** extra space.
