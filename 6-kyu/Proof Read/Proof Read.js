/*
### **Thought Process / Intuition**:

1. **Normalize the Input**:  
   Since the virus randomly capitalized letters, we first lowercase everything with `.toLowerCase()` to clean up the case inconsistencies.

2. **Fix the 'ie' vs 'ei' Swaps**:  
   The virus is known to have swapped 'i' and 'e' in `'ei'` words (like "caffeine", "their"). So, we assume all 'ie' occurrences in such words should be 'ei'.  
   Thatâ€™s why we replace all `'ie'` with `'ei'`.

3. **Fix Sentence Capitalization**:  
   Sentences are supposed to start with a capital letter. The regex `/(^|\. )(.)/g`:
   - Matches either the **start of the string** `^` or a **period and space** `\. `.
   - Then captures the **next letter** (.) which should be capitalized.
   - The callback reconstructs the sentence by keeping the matched part (`a`) and capitalizing the second character (`b`).
