## Description

You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a virus suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the `'i'`s and `'e'`s in `'ei'` words and capitalised random letters.

Write a function which will:

1. Remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Examples of 'ei' words: their, caffeine, deceive, weight)
2. Only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the rest of the sentence is in lower case. Each sentence is separated by a full stop.

Example:

`He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne.` --> `He had eight shots of caffeine.`
