/* 
Explanation:

Edge Case Handling:
If the input string is empty, return 0.

Initialize Variables:
maxLength keeps track of the length of the longest palindrome found, initialized to 1 because the minimum length of any palindrome is 1 (a single character).

Expand Around Center:
This helper function takes two pointers (left and right) and expands outward as long as the substring remains a palindrome.
If the substring is longer than the current maxLength, update it.

Loop Through String:
Consider each character as the center of a potential palindrome.
Check for both odd-length palindromes (single center) and even-length palindromes (dual center).

Time Complexity:
Each expansion around a center is linear in the worst case, and there are O(n) centers (2n - 1, including odd and even centers).
Hence, the overall time complexity is O(nÂ²).

Space Complexity:
Since we are not using extra space for dynamic programming or storing substrings, the space complexity is O(1).
