/*
We need to simulate fish growth based on consumption rules. The key is to **maximize growth** by always eating the largest fish possible that you can currently consume.
---

### ðŸ”Ž Explanation

1. **Frequency Count**
   We count how many fish exist for each size `1-9`. `0` (algae) is ignored since it doesnâ€™t feed.

2. **Growth Mechanism**

   * Start at size = 1.
   * Growth follows the rule:

     * To reach size `n+1`, you need `4 * n` extra "size-1 fish equivalent".
     * A fish of size `k` contributes `k` units.

   Example:

   * From size 1 to 2 â†’ need 4
   * From size 2 to 3 â†’ need 8 more (total 12)
   * From size 3 to 4 â†’ need 12 more (total 24), etc.

3. **Eating Loop**

   * At each stage, eat all fish `<= size`.
   * For each eaten fish, add its contribution to `eaten`.
   * If threshold reached â†’ grow, update requirement.

4. **Stopping Condition**

   * If in a full pass no fish were eaten â†’ stop (either all eaten, or only bigger ones left).

### âœ… Example Dry Runs

**Input:** `"11112222"`

* Eat 4x1 â†’ +4 â†’ size 2
* Eat 4x2 â†’ +8 â†’ size 3
  **Output:** `3`

**Input:** `"111111111111"`

* Eat 12x1 â†’ +12 â†’ size 3
  **Output:** `3`

**Input:** `"345"`

* Start size=1, canâ€™t eat â†’ stays `1`
  **Output:** `1`
