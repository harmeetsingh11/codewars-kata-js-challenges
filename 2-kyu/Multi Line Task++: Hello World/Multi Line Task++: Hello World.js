### Approach/Intuition:
The core idea is to create the string `"Hello, world!"` using very compact JavaScript syntax, while adhering to the constraint that **every line must have at most 2 characters**. The solution leverages string manipulation techniques like the `.bind()` method and clever splitting of the string to meet these constraints.

### Explanation:
- **`f=`**: This initializes the function `f` as a variable that will eventually hold the final string.
- **`''`**: This starts with an empty string.
- **`[ 'trim' ]`**: This creates an array with the string `'trim'`. In JavaScript, the string `'trim'` is a method for trimming whitespace from a string.
- **`['trim']['bind']`**: The `bind` method is used here, but in a somewhat unconventional way. Normally, `bind` is used to bind a function's context, but here it's used creatively to execute the rest of the characters in the final string.
- **`H e l l o , w o r l d !`**: The string `"Hello, world!"` is split into individual characters, and each character is placed one by one, with the backslash (`\`) used to escape characters and keep them on separate lines.
- The result of all these manipulations ultimately produces the desired string `"Hello, world!"`.

### code with comments:

```js
Start with an empty string
f=

Create an array with 'trim' as its only element
''[

  Use 'trim' method to bind with 'bind', resulting in a clever use of 'trim' 
  't' // First character in 'trim'
  'r' // Second character in 'trim'
  'i' // Third character in 'trim'
  'm' // Fourth character in 'trim'
][

  Use the 'bind' method to link with the next part of the string
  'b' // First character in 'bind'
  'i' // Second character in 'bind'
  'n' // Third character in 'bind'
  'd' // Fourth character in 'bind'
]

Assemble the string "Hello, world!" using this trick, breaking it down into parts
`H` // H
`e` // e
`l` // l
`l` // l
`o` // o
`,` // ,
` ` // space
`w` // w
`o` // o
`r` // r
`l` // l
`d` // d
`!` 
```

### Key Points:
- **Splitting and Binding**: The method uses **splitting** (`'trim'` and `'bind'`) to break down the string into smaller pieces while maintaining the required character length.
- **Escaping Characters**: The backslash (`\`) is used to ensure that each character fits within the **2-character-per-line** limit.
- **Creativity in String Construction**: The solution demonstrates creative use of JavaScript functions like `bind` and string escaping to meet constraints that would otherwise seem difficult.

This approach is clever and efficient while meeting the constraints provided!
