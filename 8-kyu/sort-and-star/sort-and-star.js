/* 
Explanation:

Check for Vowel Character Codes: This part of the function verifies if any of the numbers in arr match the ASCII codes for lowercase vowels. However, we don't use this value as part of the final return since it seems the output only requires the formatted string.

Sort the Array and Get the First String: The sort() method orders the array alphabetically. Then, we select the first element in the sorted array.

Format and Return the String: The first string is split into individual characters, joined by "***", and returned directly.

This solution is efficient and concise, handling both tasks in a clean way. It performs in O(nlogn) due to sorting and uses native array methods for simplicity and clarity.
