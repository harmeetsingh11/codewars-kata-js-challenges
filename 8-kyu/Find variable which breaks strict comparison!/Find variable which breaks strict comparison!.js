//  Function to return a value that makes strict comparison false.
//  @returns {number} NaN, the only value in JavaScript where x === x evaluates to false.

function findSpecialValue() {
  return NaN; // NaN is the only value in JS where x !== x
}

// Test case
const x = findSpecialValue();
console.log(x === x); // Output: false

Explanation:

Understanding NaN:
NaN is a special numeric value representing "Not-a-Number." It is typically the result of invalid arithmetic operations like 0 / 0 or Math.sqrt(-1).

NaN is Not Equal to Itself:
By definition in the IEEE 754 standard (which JavaScript follows for floating-point numbers), NaN is not equal to any value, including itself. Thus, NaN === NaN is always false.

Function Implementation:
The findSpecialValue function simply returns NaN, which guarantees that x === x will be false.

Key Takeaway:
This behavior demonstrates a quirk of the IEEE 754 standard and JavaScript's handling of NaN. Itâ€™s a good example of why you should use Number.isNaN(x) to explicitly check for NaN instead of relying on equality checks.
