## Description

Your task is to create a function that performs four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments:
- `operation` (string/char): The mathematical operation to perform. It can be one of the following: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- `value1` (number): The first operand.
- `value2` (number): The second operand.

The function should return the result of applying the chosen operation to the given numbers.

## Examples (Operator, value1, value2) --> output

```
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7
```
