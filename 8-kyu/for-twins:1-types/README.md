## Description

### Prolog:
This kata series was created for friends of mine who just started to learn programming. Wish you all the best and keep your mind open and sharp!

Task:
Write a function that will accept two parameters: `variable` and `type` and check if type of `variable` is matching `type`. Return `true` if types match or `false` if not.

### Examples:

```js
42, "number"   --> true
"42", "number" --> false
```
