function litres(time) {
  // Multiply time by 0.5 to get litres and use Math.floor to round down to the nearest integer
  return Math.floor(time * 0.5);

/* 
Explanation:

Calculate Litres:
Multiply the time by 0.5 to calculate the number of litres Nathan drinks (since he drinks 0.5 litres per hour).

Round Down:
Use Math.floor() to round down to the nearest integer, as required.
