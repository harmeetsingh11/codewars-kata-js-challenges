## Description

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

**Examples**
```
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```
> [!NOTE]
> - The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
> - Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
