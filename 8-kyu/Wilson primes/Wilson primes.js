/*
### Explanation:
- A **Wilson prime** satisfies:  
  \[(P - 1)! + 1 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ P^2)\]
- Only **three** Wilson primes are known: `5`, `13`, and `563`.
- Computing `(P - 1)!` for large `P` is extremely **inefficient** and **unnecessary**.
- So, the most efficient way is to **hardcode** these values â€” as they are the **only known solutions**.
