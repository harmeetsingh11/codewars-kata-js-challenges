function distanceBetweenPoints(a, b) {
  // Using the Euclidean distance formula: √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
  return Math.sqrt((b.x - a.x) ** 2 + (b.y - a.y) ** 2);
}

/*
Explanation:

Formula: The Euclidean distance formula is used:
distance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
This calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a 2D space.

Parameters:
a and b are objects representing the points with x and y properties.

Implementation:
Subtract the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.
Square the differences, add them together, and then compute the square root using Math.sqrt.

Efficiency:
The function uses a single formula and operates in O(1) time complexity since it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations.

Precision:
JavaScript's Math.sqrt and arithmetic operations ensure that results are accurate within the required tolerance of 1×10^−6
